I"±<p>The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural language. Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages.</p>

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>

<p>The most stable Windows downloads are available from the Python for Windows page. On Windows you have a choice between 32-bit (labeled x86) and and 64-bit (labeled x86-64) versions, and several flavors of installer for each. The Python core team thinks there should be a default you don‚Äôt have to stop and think about, so the yellow download button on the main download page gets you the ‚Äúx86 executable installer‚Äù choice. This is actually a fine choice: you don‚Äôt need the 64-bit version even if you have 64-bit Windows, the 32-bit Python will work just fine.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre running Windows XP: a complete guide to installing ActivePython is at Python on XP: 7 Minutes To ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù. ShowMeDo has two videos for downloading, installing and getting started with Python on a Windows XP machine - this series talks you through the Python, ActivePython and SciPy distributions. Note that the python.org releases only support versions of Windows that are supported by Microsoft (at the time of the release), so no recent release from python.org can be used on WIndows XP.</p>

<h3 id="mac">Mac</h3>

<p>See the Python for Mac OS X page. MacOS from 10.2 (Jaguar) to 10.15 (Catalina) includes a system version of Python 2, but it is best not to consider this the Python to use for your programming tasks - install a current Python 3.x version instead. MacOS after 10.15 (Catalina) will not include a default system Python.</p>

<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>

<p>For Red Hat, CentOS or Fedora, install the python3 and python3-devel packages.</p>

<p>For Debian or Ubuntu, install the python3.x and python3.x-dev packages.</p>

<p>For Gentoo, install the ‚Äò=python-3.x*‚Äô ebuild (you may have to unmask it first).</p>

<p>For other systems, or if you want to install from source, see the [general download page</p>
